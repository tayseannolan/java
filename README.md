<h1>Implementation of Hash Function Using Hash Tables</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Design an application that will assist the staff to extract the client information, update
client’s record and delete it if necessary. There is a large number of clients and 
all client’s record efficiently depend on the algorithm. Collision are considered.

<h2>Design</h2>


Program that will depict the search, insertions and deletion functions. Test cases available for verification of the implementation. 
Multiple ways of implementing a hash table using several hash functions.

Method 1: Linear Chain

Method 2: Linear Probing

Method 3: Double Hashing

<h1>Additional Applications</h1>

1. Find minimum amount of coins needed to make change

2. Find all solutions for making change with coins

3. Calculate Travel Distance
